42 Abu Dhabi Projects

This repo documents my journey at 42 Abu Dhabi, a project-based coding school with peer-to-peer learning and no teachers.

Tips:
- DON'T Waste time learning everything perfectly, just learn what is needed (and understand it) as much as you can.
- Learn Array Manipulation & 2D Array Manipulation (Very useful for strings & array of strings)
- Make sure to understand how pointers operate or else you won't be able to move forward properly.
- Don't go above C07 without fully internalizing and understanding all previous projects.


Projects & Their Ideas:

C00–C02: Basics, memory, and string functions & how to replicate them

C03–C05: Advanced strings, recursion, math functions

C06–C07: Command-line args & dynamic memory (Malloc)

C08: Structs & header files (If it's your first piscine then too advanced, You Don't Need it Yet..)
